1. **You**: Explain the following code in detail: 
```csharp
var message4 = "Uma mensagemaleatória";
```
2. **ChatGPT**: Certainly! The provided code is a C# statement that declares a variable named `message4` and assigns it the value "Uma mensagemaleatória". Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. `var`: In C#, `var` is an implicit type specifier that allows the compiler to determine the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it. In this case, `message4` will be of type `string`.

2. `message4`: This is the name of the variable being declared.

3. `=`: This is the assignment operator used to assign a value to a variable.

4. `"Uma mensagemaleatória"`: This is the string literal being assigned to the variable `message4`. In C#, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.

Therefore, the code line `var message4 = "Uma mensagemaleatória";` declares a variable `message4` of type `string` and assigns it the value "Uma mensagemaleatória". This variable can now be used throughout the program to store and manipulate the specified string value.
